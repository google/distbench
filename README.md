# Distbench README

## Introduction

Distbench is a tool for synthesizing a variety of network traffic patterns used
in distributed systems, and evaluating their performance across multiple
networking stacks.

A Distbench experiment consists of a single controller process and a set of
worker processes. The controller initiates a traffic pattern among the set of
workers, monitors traffic and generates a performance report for the RPCs. The
traffic pattern, specified spatially and temporally and the RPC stack are all
configurable by the controller.

## Why Use Distbench ?

Use Distbench to:

- Identify system bottlenecks for various common distributed computing tasks,
- Compare RPC stack performance for various common traffic patterns,
- Evaluate the impact of system configurations, application threading models and
  kernel configurations on large, scale-out applications.
